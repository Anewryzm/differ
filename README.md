- Supports polygons and circles, currently.
- A work in progress, see tests for an nme project testing the code.
- Contributions welcome

** Getting Started ** 

For now, git clone the repo or use 

`haxelib git hxcollision https://github.com/FuzzYspo0N/hxcollision.git hxcollision`

If you have trouble getting it working, check that the .dev file inside :

`..haxelibs../hxcollision/git/` 

is pointing at the root git folder, not the child hxcollision path. It seems haxelib points it one too deep.
